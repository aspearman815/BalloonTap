# BalloonTap
To use this app first open the Corona simulator. The app has a balloon in the center with a black bar along the bottom. Once you tap the balloon with your cursor, the balloon will bounce. There is a counter at the top of the app screen that keep track of how many times the balloon has been tapped.
